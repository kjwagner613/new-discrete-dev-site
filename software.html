              <h2>Discrete Work Tools</h2>
              <p class="lede">A custom coded solution based on ERP functionality, designed with our philosophy of
                sophistication through simplicity, built to streamline workflows, enhance data accuracy, and improve
                overall operational efficiency. Begun with the user expeience in mind.

                <h3 class="migrate">Purpose</h3>
                <p class="lede">
                  There is tremendous functionality in business software systems. Most try to make a version with every
                  known requirement a client could request. Then trim it down for a prospective client when they are
                  interested.</p>
                <p class="lede">
                  To serve and support all the potential, it requires a massive framework. routes, functions, so much
                  extra code that will not be used, and not needed for most businesses. They give you a list of
                  available modules and functions contained in the business represented by those modules. The client
                  only needs to point them out.</p>
                <p class="lede">
                  I see constraint in that approach. Providing a set defines a boundary. It is your system, it should do
                  what you need it to, what you want it to. Technological advancement, modernization, does not have to
                  be restrictive. We don't take shortcuts. Lets make it freeing.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div class="pillar">
                <h3 class="migrate">Objective</h3>
                <p class="lede">
                  The objective is to build a tool to provide infrastructure for business processes, and adhere to lean
                  principles itself. No waste. No overengineering. Simple in its production version. Reliable. More than
                  adequate to create and maintain a customer database. Create Sales Orders, help manage and plan
                  production. Connect the departments with an intuitive, minimal learning curve to promote adoption.
                  Address many of the complaints users post today regarding interfaces and complexity that does not
                  match the ability of the software.
                </p>

                <h3 class="migrate">Sample</h3>
                <p class="lede">
                  This sample is not fully functional. It is scaffolded. Foundation laid. the SD module coded and
                  assembled. The rest of the modules are outlined, with data models defined. The intention is to
                  provide a clear example of how the philosophy is applied to a real world application.
